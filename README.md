# Who am I?

- **Joran de Boer**
- **28 years old**
- **From the Netherlands**
- **Graduated in 'Art: Decoration and Restoration'**
- **Self-Taught in (mostly) Front-End skills**

As a kid, I could be found either with a pencil in my hand or sitting in front of a PC, but my studies have always been oriented towards more artistic endeavors. My interest in programming, triggered by an HTML-course I did during my study, came as a pleasant, yet fitting, surprise!

After I graduated from the study 'Art: Restoration and Decoration' I was left unsatisfied. It started to dawn on me that art might not be the best career choice. Obviously, because it doesn't offer a stable income, but mainly because I started to realize I prefer to keep it as a hobby, allowing me to have full control and create whatever I want.

When I started programming I discovered it doesn't just allow me to be creative but it also scratches an entirely different part of my brain. It allows me to think analytically and create structure and challenges me to solve complex problems. With every new little thing I learn my enthusiasm and motivation is re-energized which often sparks several new project ideas. 

For me, art is more a means of expression and creative outlet. Programming is a skill I want master.

As of now I have mostly been focusing on improving my Front-End skills, but with the start of my study I will also be diving into the Back-End. 

Of course I'll continue to work on personal projects in my free time. I have more ideas than time and keep adding new entries to my [list of interests](#what-else-do-i-want-to-create-or-learn-in-the-future).
