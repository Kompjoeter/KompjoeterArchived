# Who am I?

- **Joran de Boer**
- **28 years old**
- **From the Netherlands**
- **Graduated in 'Art: Decoration and Restoration'**
- **Self-Taught in (mostly) Front-End skills**

As a kid, I could be found either with a pencil in my hand or [in front of a computer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RanDByyp/RanDByyp/master/20201027_201220_mfnr.jpg). Eventually I decided to combine the two and started studying Game-Design (Focussing on Concept Art). Despite my still lingering interest in Game-Development, this didn't work out and I quit before I finished the study. 

After some searching and looking into different studies I set my targets on the study of 'Art: Decoration and Restoration'. It was not entirely what I expected, but I got my degree and spend half a year painting on canvas during an amazing internship. When I finished, however, I was left unsatisfied. 

I considered going to an actual Art Academy but after realizing that it probably wouldn't offer me a stable income, I instead started working for my brother as a house painter while I re-evaluated what I wanted out of a job. 

During this time I started looking into programming, inspired by a HTML course I did during my study. My interest in it came as a surprise! I find it offers both breadth and depth, yet is more tangible and less subjective than art. It satisfies both the creative and analytical parts of my brain and it started to dawn on me that it was a far better fit, job-wise, than art. 

In art I like to have full control, it's something I do for fun and to express myself and I wouldn't enjoy having to make concessions for a paying customer. With programming I don't have this problem. Of course there are certain type of projects I prefer to work on, but I enjoy the whole process of it. It's challenging and there's always something new to learn which only fuels my enthusiasm more!

 <summary>What do you mean by <i>'I find it (programming) offers both breadth and depth,</i><b> yet is more tangible and less subjective than art.'?:</b>
 </summary>

As I see it, in art the artist usually tries to make something beautifull, wants to leave an impression or tell a story. It's up to them to decide what medium they use for this and how they go about it. Of course there are certain ideas about 'what makes a good composition' or 'which colors fit well together', but in the end whether something is appealing, or even considered art, is simply a question of taste and opinion. There are little to no consequenses to whether one paints a blue or red sky. One can even decide to leave a canvas blank and consider it finished! The way I experience art is very freeform. I do what I think is right, but I don't stop to measure it to a set standard. I would prefer that people like the things I make, but I don't think their opinion makes the things I make any less self-expressive, or any less 'art'.

In programming I find much more clarity! There is a more distinct divide between 'good'and 'bad'. You can definitely have discussions about 'naming conventions', or think up multiple suitable solutions to a problem, but you can be certain your program won't run correctly, or run at all, if you don't give the correct instructions to the computer. I find the restrictions and structure that programming offers both challenging and comforting. My code can be measured by the results it puts out and thus the road to improvement is far clearer.

I love art for the freedom it offers but as I said, I realized I prefer it as hobby and as a means for creative-expression. My perspective on programming seems to be opposite of that. I'm curious about what the 'standards' are within the coding world. Which tools and languages are best suited for what type of projects? How can I organize my code better? What solution is best suited for X problem? These questions and their answers are fuel for my enthusiasm and make me want to keep learning more!

Currently, I focus on improving my front-end skills, but my [list of interests](#what-else-do-i-want-to-create-or-learn-in-the-future) keeps growing! I still paint on canvas, when I can find the time, and I'm curious to someday combine my interest in art with my interest in programming.
