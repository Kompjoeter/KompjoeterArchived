Having spent most of my life pursuing art, my interest in programming came as a surprise. I find it offers both a breadth and depth, yet is more tangible and less subjective than art. It's a fresh wind I mean to explore further.

Currently, I am focused on improving my frond-end skills but I'm also very excited about Generative Art, Procedural Generation and Game Development. When I can find the time I paint on canvas and I'm curious to someday combine this with my interest in programming.
